\chapter{Auxiliary Programs}

Besides the main {\tt yosys} executable, the Yosys distribution contains a set
of additional helper programs.

\section{yosys-config}

The {\tt yosys-config} tool (an auto-generated shell-script) can be used to
query compiler options and other information needed for building loadable
modules for Yosys. FIXME: See Sec.~\ref{chapter:prog} for details.

\section{yosys-filterlib}
\label{sec:filterlib}

The {\tt yosys-filterlib} tool is a small utility that can be used to strip
or extract information from a Liberty file. See Sec.~\ref{sec:techmap_extern}
for details.

\section{yosys-abc}

This is a unmodified copy of ABC \citeweblink{ABC}. Not all versions of Yosys
work with all versions of ABC. So Yosys comes with its own yosys-abc to avoid
compatibility issues between the two.
