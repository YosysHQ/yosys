\subsection{Digital Circuit Synthesis}

\begin{frame}{\subsecname}
	Synthesis Tools (such as Yosys) can transform HDL code to circuits:

\subsection{What Yosys can and can't do}

\begin{frame}{\subsecname}

Things Yosys can do:
\begin{itemize}
\item Read and process (most of) modern Verilog-2005 code.
\item Perform all kinds of operations on netlist (RTL, Logic, Gate).
\item Perform logic optimizations and gate mapping with ABC\footnote[frame]{\url{http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~alanmi/abc/}}.
\end{itemize}

\bigskip
Things Yosys can't do:
\begin{itemize}
\item Process high-level languages such as C/C++/SystemC.
\item Create physical layouts (place\&route).
\end{itemize}

\bigskip
A typical flow combines Yosys with with a low-level implementation tool, such
as Qflow\footnote[frame]{\url{http://opencircuitdesign.com/qflow/}} for ASIC designs.

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Yosys Data- and Control-Flow}

\begin{frame}{\subsecname}
	A (usually short) synthesis script controls Yosys.

	This scripts contain three types of commands:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item {\bf Frontends}, that read input files (usually Verilog).
	\item {\bf Passes}, that perform transformations on the design in memory.
	\item {\bf Backends}, that write the design in memory to a file (various formats are available: Verilog, BLIF, EDIF, SPICE, BTOR, \dots).
	\end{itemize}

	\bigskip
	\begin{center}
	\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.6, every node/.style={transform shape}]

\subsection{Currently unsupported Verilog-2005 language features}

\begin{frame}{\subsecname}
\begin{itemize}
\item Tri-state logic
\item The wor/wand wire types (maybe for 0.5)
\item Latched logic (is synthesized as logic with feedback loops)
\item Some non-synthesizable features that should be ignored in synthesis are not supported by the parser and cause a parser error (file a bug report if you encounter this problem)
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\subsection{Verification of Yosys}

\begin{frame}{\subsecname}
Continuously checking the correctness of Yosys and making sure that new features
do not break old ones is a high priority in Yosys.

\bigskip
Two external test suites have been built for Yosys: VlogHammer and yosys-bigsim
(see next slides)

\bigskip
In addition to that, yosys comes with $\approx\!200$ test cases used in ``{\tt make test}''.

\bigskip
A debug build of Yosys also contains a lot of asserts and checks the integrity of
the internal state after each command.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{\subsecname{} -- VlogHammer}
VlogHammer is a Verilog regression test suite developed to test the different
subsystems in Yosys by comparing them to each other and to the output created
by some other tools (Xilinx Vivado, Xilinx XST, Altera Quartus II, ...).

\bigskip
Yosys Subsystems tested: Verilog frontend, const folding, const eval, technology mapping,
simulation models, SAT models.

\bigskip
Thousands of auto-generated test cases containing code such as:
\begin{lstlisting}[xleftmargin=1cm, basicstyle=\ttfamily\fontsize{8pt}{10pt}\selectfont, language=Verilog]
assign y9 = $signed(((+$signed((^(6'd2 ** a2))))<$unsigned($unsigned(((+a3))))));
assign y10 = (-((+((+{2{(~^p13)}})))^~(!{{b5,b1,a0},(a1&p12),(a4+a3)})));
assign y11 = (~&(-{(-3'sd3),($unsigned($signed($unsigned({p0,b4,b1}))))}));
\end{lstlisting}

\bigskip
Some bugs in Yosys where found and fixed thanks to VlogHammer. Over 50 bugs in
the other tools used as external reference where found and reported so far.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{\subsecname{} -- yosys-bigsim}
yosys-bigsim is a collection of real-world open-source Verilog designs and test
benches. yosys-bigsim compares the testbench outputs of simulations of the original
Verilog code and synthesis results.

\bigskip
The following designs are included in yosys-bigsim (excerpt):
\begin{itemize}
\item {\tt openmsp430} -- an MSP430 compatible 16 bit CPU
\item {\tt aes\_5cycle\_2stage} -- an AES encryption core
\item {\tt softusb\_navre} -- an AVR compatible 8 bit CPU
\item {\tt amber23} -- an ARMv2 compatible 32 bit CPU
\item {\tt lm32} -- another 32 bit CPU from Lattice Semiconductor
\item {\tt verilog-pong} -- a hardware pong game with VGA output
\item {\tt elliptic\_curve\_group} -- ECG point-add and point-scalar-mul core
\item {\tt reed\_solomon\_decoder} -- a Reed-Solomon Error Correction Decoder
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Benefits of Open Source HDL Synthesis}

\begin{frame}{\subsecname}
\begin{itemize}
\item Cost (also applies to ``free as in free beer'' solutions)
\item Availability and Reproducibility
\item Framework- and all-in-one-aspects
\item Educational Tool
\end{itemize}

\bigskip

Yosys is open source under the ISC license.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{\subsecname{} -- 1/3}
\begin{itemize}
\item Cost (also applies to ``free as in free beer'' solutions): \smallskip\par
Today the cost for a mask set in $\unit[180]{nm}$ technology is far less than
the cost for the design tools needed to design the mask layouts. Open Source
ASIC flows are an important enabler for ASIC-level Open Source Hardware.

\bigskip
\item Availability and Reproducibility: \smallskip\par
If you are a researcher who is publishing, you want to use tools that everyone
else can also use. Even if most universities have access to all major
commercial tools, you usually do not have easy access to the version that was
used in a research project a couple of years ago. With Open Source tools you
can even release the source code of the tool you have used alongside your data.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{\subsecname{} -- 2/3}
\begin{itemize}
\item Framework: \smallskip\par
Yosys is not only a tool. It is a framework that can be used as basis for other
developments, so researchers and hackers alike do not need to re-invent the
basic functionality. Extensibility was one of Yosys' design goals.

\bigskip
\item All-in-one: \smallskip\par
Because of the framework characteristics of Yosys, an increasing number of features
become available in one tool. Yosys not only can be used for circuit synthesis but
also for formal equivalence checking, SAT solving, and for circuit analysis, to
name just a few other application domains. With proprietary software one needs to
learn a new tool for each of these applications.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{\subsecname{} -- 3/3}
\begin{itemize}
\item Educational Tool: \smallskip\par
Proprietary synthesis tools are at times very secretive about their inner
workings. They often are ``black boxes''. Yosys is very open about its
internals and it is easy to observe the different steps of synthesis.
\end{itemize}

flows (using either the BLIF and BTOR backends).

\bigskip
\item I know some analog chip designers that use Yosys for small digital
control logic because it is simpler than setting up a commercial flow.
