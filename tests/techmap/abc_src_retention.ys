# Test that \src attributes are preserved through ABC synthesis
# when node retention is available in the ABC output.
#
# NOTE: This test requires an ABC binary with node_retention support
# (e.g., from robtaylor/abc branch node_retention).
# When using stock ABC, the retention section won't be present and
# \src attributes won't be recovered (but the pass won't error).
