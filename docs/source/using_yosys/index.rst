Using Yosys (advanced)
======================

While much of Yosys is focused around synthesis, there are also a number of
other useful things that can be accomplished with Yosys scripts or in an
interactive shell.  As such this section is broken into two parts:
:doc:`/using_yosys/synthesis/index` expands on the
:doc:`/getting_started/example_synth` and goes into further detail on the major
commands used in synthesis; :doc:`/using_yosys/more_scripting/index` covers the
ways Yosys can interact with designs for a deeper investigation.
